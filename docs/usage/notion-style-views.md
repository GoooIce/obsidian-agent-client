# Notion-Style Chat Views

Agent Client introduces a new way to interact with your AI agents, inspired by Notion's flexible interface: **Floating Chat**. This view allows for a more seamless and integrated workflow.

## Floating Chat

The Floating Chat is a persistent, collapsible chat window that stays with you as you navigate your vault. It's perfect for quick questions or ongoing tasks that don't require a dedicated pane.

### Features

-   **Floating Action Button**: A customizable button (defaulting to the bottom-right corner) toggles the chat window.
-   **Persistent State**: The chat stays open or closed as you switch between notes.
-   **Independent Session**: The floating chat maintains its own session, separate from other chat views.
-   **Agent Switching**: Easily switch between agents directly from the floating header.

### Configuration

You can customize the Floating Chat in **Settings → Agent Client**:

-   **Show Floating Button**: Toggle the feature on or off.
-   **Button Image**: Provide a path to a custom image (local path or URL) to replace the default icon.
    -   *Tip:* Local images from your vault are fully supported!
-   **Window Size**: Adjust the default width and height of the floating window.
-   **Window Position**: The window's position is saved automatically when you move it.
